## Bio of Student 

- Yun is a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at New York University with emphasis on data science. It is not surprising that he is not only familiar with regular conventions (e.g. Git) and programming languages (e.g. C++) of software development, but also has solid knowledge of theories related to neural network and other machine learning applications. As a proof-of-concept to implement high-level API of LSTM for MXNet which is [part of project goals](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1420), he had already built a many-to-many [RNN model](https://gist.github.com/Puriney/072a37ea8a181f0b6168) from scratch,  which was implemented in Rcpp and managed to learn 8-bit binary addition calculation. Therefore the CS background supports Yun to read the source code of MXNet, identify useful but absent features, and ultimately finish implementation.
- Yun is an experienced R user who has been participating in developing R package. For example, [ChIPseeker](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html), a Bioconductor package for bioinformatics analysis; [honfleuR](https://github.com/Puriney/honfleuR), an extension supporting object-oriented programming in R S4 methods for an existed R package to analyze single-cell sequencing data. Therefore his strong interest and 4-year experience in R language make him a self-motivated and competent participant to help make a powerful deep learning package dedicated to R language community.
- Yun has rich research experience in computational biology with a Master degree in Molecular Biology. He realized deep learning is becoming a promising strategy to analyze large scale of data produced by biomedical studies. Therefore Yun has solid expert-domain knowledge and strong interest to apply deep learning to computational biology field by writing application examples for MXNet package. Therefore Yun's participation can bring to new impacts -- deep learning has a soft-landing on life sciences researches thanks to  MXNet's R package and likewise MXNet becomes more appealing to bioinformaticians and broaden user spectrum.

## CODING PLAN & METHODS

Describe in detail your plan for completing the work.  What functions will be written, how and when will you do design, how will you verify the results of your coding?  

### R language specific domain


### Deep learning specific domain

#### RNN
Implement abstraction supporting one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many RNN models.

### Application specific domain

Describe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them.



## TIMELINE

(consult GSOC schedule)

Provide a detailed timeline of how you plan to spend your summer.  **Don't leave testing and documentation for last**, as that's almost a guarantee of a failed project. 

What is your contingency plan for things not going to schedule? 


## MANAGEMENT OF CODING PROJECT

How do you propose to ensure code is submitted / tested?

How often do you plan to commit?  What changes in commit behavior would indicate a problem?


## TEST

Describe the qualification test that you have submitted to you project mentors.  If feasible, include code, details, output, and example of similar coding problems that you have solved.
